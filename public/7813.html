            <p>1.    The matured sex cell which takes part in sexual reproduction is referred to as </p>
	
            <p>A.  gamete   </p>
            <p>B.  fetus   </p>
            <p>C.   embryo  </p>
            <p>D.  zygote   </p>
            <p>   Gametes are reproductive cells (sex cells) that unite during sexual reproduction to form a new cell called a zygote. Male gametes are sperm and female gametes are ova (eggs).
Embryo is the stage of animal development in the uterus before the animal is considered a fetus. In humans this is equivalent to the first three months.  </p>

            <!--question2-->
            <p>2.   The biome that is characterized with large herbivores, few and scattered fire resistant trees is  </p>
            <p>A.  savanna   </p>
            <p>B.   tropical rain forest  </p>
            <p>C.  montane forest   </p>
            <p>D.   desert  </p>
            <p>  Savannas are quite low in tree species diversity because of itement ecological requirements but fairly high in diversity of herbaceous plants. Tree growth is controlled not only by rainfall but also by soil type; large areas of hardpan soils, allow no tree roots to penetrate except through cracks, and the cracks determine tree distribution.
Large mammals are at their most diverse in this open environment, in which they can move about freely and yet find shelter among woody vegetation. Large herbivores are successful because of the tremendous biomass of herbaceous vegetation produced annually, and there are many carnivores to crop them in turn.
Tropical rain forests occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season, distinct buttress roots of trees.
Montane forest refers to any ecosystem found in mountains. These ecosystems are strongly affected by climate, which gets colder as elevation increases.
A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life.

            <p>C.   phagocytes  </p>
            <p>D. leucocytes    </p>
            <p>   Red blood cell also known as erythrocyte disk-shaped, biconcave cell in the blood that contains hemoglobin, lacks a nucleus, and transports oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues

White blood cells or leukocytes, are cells of the immune system involved in defending the body against both infectious disease and foreign materials.

Platelets, or thrombocytes or yellow blood cells, are very small, irregularly shaped clear cell fragments (i.e. cells that do not have a nucleus containing DNA. Platelets are a natural source of growth factors. They circulate in the blood of mammals and are involved in hemostasis, leading to the formation of blood clots.

Phagocytes are cells that protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or dying cells  </p>

            <p>4.   The joint between the femur and tibia is known as ________  </p>
            <p>A.  hinge joint   </p>
            <p>B.   ball-and-socket joint  </p>
            <p>C. pivot joint    </p>
            <p>D. gliding joint    </p>
            <p>  The knee joint is one of the strongest and most important joints in the human body. It allows the lower leg to move relative to the thigh while supporting the body’s weight.

Movements at the knee joint are essential to many everyday activities, including walking, running, sitting and standing.

The knee, also known as the hinge joint(tibiofemoral joint) formed between three bones: the femur, tibia, and patella.

A gliding joint, also known as a plane joint or planar joint, is a common type of joint formed between bones that meet at flat or nearly flat articular surfaces.

Pivot joint, also called rotary joint is a freely moveable joint that allows only rotary movement around a single axis. Pivot joints also provide for the twisting movement of the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) against the upper arm.

The ball and socket joint (or spheroidal joint) is a type of synovial joint which enables the bone to move in many places (nearly all directions). These are found in the hip.   </p>

            <p>D.   contains only proteins  </p>
            <p>    It consists of a lipid bi-layer with embedded proteins. The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings.

The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles. In this way, it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules </p>

            <!--question9-->
            <p>9.   The feeding relationship among a set of members of a community is referred to as _______  </p>
            <p>A.   a food web  </p>
            <p>B.  pyramid of energy   </p>
            <p>C.  a food chain   </p>
            <p>D.  pyramid of member   </p>
            <p>  Feeding relationships between organisms in a community are represented by food chains, which show the sequence in which organisms feed on each other. The chain generally begins with an autotroph such as a green plant (e.g. stinging nettle ---> small tortoiseshell butterfly caterpillar --> house sparrow --> sparrowhawk), or with dead organic matter (detritus) (e.g. leaf litter --> earthworm --> young blackbird --> fox). The arrows indicate the passage of food, and therefore energy flow, from one organism to another.

Pyramids of energy are the most accurate representation of feeding relationships in a community, providing information about the amount of energy flowing through each trophic level over a set period of time.

Food web involve many complex feeding relationship and most ecosystems are more complex than food chain   </p>

            <!--question10-->
            <p>10.   Nitrogen is released into the atmosphere when ________  </p>
            <p>A.   plants absorbs mineral salt  </p>
            <p>B.  sugar is completely broken down   </p>
            <p>C.  through plant uptake   </p>
            <p>D.   when lightning strike  </p>
            <p>  Nitrogen is essential to all living systems, which makes the nitrogen cycle one of Earth\'s most important nutrient cycles.

Atmospheric nitrogen becomes part of living organisms in two ways. The first is through bacteria in the soil that form nitrates out of nitrogen in the air. The second is through lightning. During electrical storms, large amounts of nitrogen are oxidized and united with water to produce an acid that falls to Earth in rainfall and deposits nitrates in the soil.   </p>

            <!--question11-->
            <p>11.  Size, colour and fingerprints are examples of ______   </p>

            <p>C.  morphological variation   </p>
            <p>D.   adaptive variation  </p>
            <p>  Morphological variation includes aspects of the outward appearance i.e shape, structure, color, pattern, size which is in contrast to physiology variation which deals primarily with function.

Morphological variation arises from a number of factors which can be bluntly classified as either genetic or environmental implanted into the process of evolution.

Discontinuous variation is variation that has distinct groups for organisms to belong to i.e tongue rolling, finger prints, eye color, blood groups

            <p>B.  Water sticks to the walls of blood vessels.   </p>
            <p>C.  Water molecules stay on the tip of a pine needle because the water is attracted to the surface of the needle   </p>
            <p>D. Water molecules stick to one another and form a bead    </p>
            <p>  Cohesion is an ability of water molecule to stick to one another due to the presence of hydrogen bonding   </p>

            <!--question14-->
            <p>14.  The common thing in plant and animal cell is   </p>

            <p>C.   nucleus  </p>
            <p>D.  centrioles   </p>
            <p>   Nucleus is a specialized structure occurring in most cells (except bacteria and blue-green algae) and separated from the rest of the cell by a double layer, the nuclear membrane. This membrane seems to be continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (a membranous network) of the cell and has pores, which probably permit the entrance of large molecules. The nucleus controls and regulates the activities of the cell (e.g., growth and metabolism) and carries the genes, structures that contain the hereditary information.

            <!--question15-->
            <p>15.   The modification in structure, physiology and behaviour of plant and animal is called ______  </p>
            <p>A.  adaption   </p>
            <p>B.   evolution  </p>
            <p>C.  variation   </p>
            <p>D.   succession  </p>
            <p>   Adaptation is process by which an animal or plant species becomes fitted to its environment; it is the result of natural selection’s acting upon heritable variation. Even the simpler organisms must be adapted in a great variety of ways: in their structure, physiology, and genetics, in their locomotion or dispersal, in their means of defense and attack, in their reproduction and development, and in other respects.


Evolution explains how living things change over a long time, and how they have come to be the way they are
Variation is any difference between cells, individual organisms, or groups of organisms of any species caused either by genetic differences (genotypic variation) or by the effect of environmental factors on the expression of the genetic potentials (phenotypic variation). Variation may be shown in physical appearance, metabolism, fertility, mode of reproduction, behaviour, learning and mental ability.

Succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community evolves over time. Two different types of succession—primary and secondary—have been distinguished. Primary succession occurs in essentially lifeless areas—regions in which the soil is incapable of sustaining life as a result of such factors as lava flows, newly formed sand dunes, or rocks left from a retreating glacier.

Secondary succession occurs in areas where a community that previously existed has been removed; it is typified by smaller-scale disturbances that do not eliminate all life and nutrients from the environment.  </p>

            <p>19.   Food chain refers to the feeding relationships between animals in a ______  </p>
            <p>A.  Family   </p>
            <p>B.  phylum   </p>
            <p>C.  community   </p>
            <p>D. group    </p>
            <p>  Food chain refers to the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to organism. Food chains intertwine locally into a food web because most organisms consume more than one type of animal or plant. Plants, which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source. In a predator chain, a plant-eating animal is eaten by a flesh-eating animal. In a parasite chain, a smaller organism consumes part of a larger host and may itself be parasitized by even smaller organisms.

In a saprophytic chain, microorganisms live on dead organic matter.   </p>

            <p>C.   saprohytic  </p>
            <p>D. carnivores    </p>
            <p>   Parasitic nutrition is heterotrophic nutrition where a parasitic organism lives on the body surface or inside the body of another type of organism (a host) and gets nutrition directly from the body of the host. Since these parasites derive nourishment from their host, this symbiotic interaction is often described as harmful to the host.
Saprotrophic nutrition is a process of chemoheterotrophic extracellular digestion involved in the processing of decayed organic matter.

The organism feeds on dead matter i.e fungi
A carnivore is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging  </p>

            <p>C.  sex-linked   </p>
            <p>D. morphological    </p>
            <p>  PTC(phenylthiocarbamide) has the unusual property that it either tastes very bitter or is virtually tasteless, depending on the genetic makeup of the taster. The ability to taste PTC is often treated as a dominant genetic trait, although inheritance and expression of this trait are somewhat more complex.

To some people, small amounts of the compounds phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taste very bitter; other people do not taste these compounds. The myth is that there are only two kinds of people, tasters and non-tasters, and that the trait is controlled by a single gene, with the allele for tasting dominant over the allele for non-tasting.
∴ ability to taste PTC in some individuals is a character that is heritable   </p>

            <p>D.   Pasteur  </p>
            <p>  Lamarck explained how evolution operated by proposing two ideas, these ideas the inheritance of acquired
traits and the use and disuse of body parts.
Lamarck had observed that a body part that is constantly used enlarges and becomes efficient; one that is not
becomes weak and small. Through this type of use and disuse; an organism acquired certain traits during its
lifetime.\n
He thought that these traits can be passed on to offspring.
* The trait in the question is the large muscles developed by the athlete.

(i) The mononuclears or agranulocytes.\n
(ii)The polymorphonuclears or granulocytes. Agranulocytes are white blood cells with clear cytoplasm and
an oval or bean-shaped nucleus. Granulocytes are with granular cytoplasm with lobed nucleus. Agranulocytes
are of two varieties namely the lymphocyte and the monocyte. Lymphocytes are concerned with the
production of anti-bodies and anti-toxins both of which protect the body from the harmful effect of disease
causing organisms i.e., they give immunity against diseases; therefore, they constitute the immune system of
the body. Monocytes are phagocytic in function; they ingest and destroy harmful micro-organisms that enter
the blood. Erythrocytes are red blood cells; they help in the transportation oxygen round the body.

            <p>   In plant science, secondary growth refers to the growth that results from cell division in the cambia or lateral
meristems and that causes the stems and roots to thicken, while primary growth is growth that occurs as a
result of cell division at the tips of stems and roots, causing them to elongate, and gives rise to primary tissue.
Secondary growth occurs in most seed plants, but monocots usually lack secondary growth. If they do have
secondary growth, it differs from the typical pattern of other seed plants.
